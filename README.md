# python_bookshelf
Application of GoogldCloudPlatform/getting-started-python https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/getting-started-python/tree/steps

## Getting Started
To connect Google Cloud SQL to local host and deploy the Bookshelf application, follow the instructions in https://cloud.google.com/python. 

## About the Code
I modified the code to enable a user searching for books and rating them. 
Modified codes are in the directory '2-structured-data/bookshelf'

## How it looks like
User can find a book by 1) title only, 2) title and year, or 3) hashtag.
